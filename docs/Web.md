# Express and Webpack Build

The setup for Express and Webpack is quite complex. This document outlines what is going on with both the Express web server, and the Webpacked javascript bundles.

* [Running a Bundle Analysis](#bundle-analysis)
* [Running the client in production, locally](#production-local)

## Bundle Analysis

You can run an analysis of the webpack bundle by running the following commands:

1. Generate a Webpack stats file from **web**
    ```bash
    NODE_ENV=production webpack --env.production --config ./config/webpack.prod.js --profile --json > stats.json
    ```
1. Due to a bug in one of the webpack plugins, edit the stats.json file and remove the first lines, that are not JSON
1. Use Webpack Bundle Analyzer to read the stats file, and generate a report
    ```bash
    ./node_modules/webpack-bundle-analyzer/lib/bin/analyzer.js stats.json
    ```

Alternatively, you can run `npm run analyze`, however note step #2.

## Production, local

1. First, you'll want to run the API in its Docker container, using docker-compose.
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --service-ports api ./wait-for.sh db:5432 -- ./run.sh devstart
    ```
2. Then, build and run the client in production from /web:
    ```bash
    API_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm run build && API_URL=http://localhost:3001 API_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3001 JWT_SECRET=jwtauthsecret NODE_ENV=production node dist/server/app.js
    ```


**Bundles**

* Each individual bundle needs an entry in the `exportedEntrypoints` object in `web/config/entryPoints.js`
* A vendor bundle is created for each entry point to reduce bundle size
* In production, bundles are hashed based on their content for caching / performance purposes

**Development**

* Express uses `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` to serve up the webpack bundles.
* A `bundles` object is created based off of the webpack.config's entry point keys using a custom webpack plugin `BundleBuilderPlugin` in `server/app.js`
* This `bundles` object is available to the entire Express app using `app.locals.bundles`
* Each Express View can access these development bundles that `webpack-dev-middleware` is serving up in memory
* Lastly, the webpack.config is adding the hot middleware entry point when in development mode. See `entryPoints` in webpack.config.js

**Production**

* Webpack creates a manifest file of hashed bundles using the `WebpackAssetsManifest` plugin, and puts it in the public directory.
* Express ignores Webpack middleware all together in production, assigning the dynamically hashed bundles to `app.locals.bundles` via the manifest.
* Hot reloading is completely ignored in production â€“ see `entryFunction` and `entryPoints` in webpack.config.js
* We are gzipping / minifying / and splitting code
